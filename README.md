Date Science Projects


A repository containing many jupyter notebook and python files on data science projects. The these projects include various data science methods and use common libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
The outline for these projets stems from Gateway Data Science, an introductory data science course offered at Johns Hopkins University. While the template for these projects is provided, the code is self-wrote.
